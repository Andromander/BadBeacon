Imagine making a Beacon one day, but instead of a Nether Star and some Obsidian, you substitute it for a Heart of the Sea and some Nether Wart Blocks.

In comes the Bad Beacon. A block with a purple light, red base, a black beam of light, and the negative effects that come with it. Build the base of Coal, Lapis Lazuli, Redstone, Nether Quartz, or Copper and pay with those similar items.
Affect everyone or just the players. Add some blocks and payment methods with a datapack.
